# About Cozy Coast
A young falconer decides to go visit their grandfather, who happens to be the only fisherman in a little rundown coastal town. Upon arrival, their grandfather asks them to help out with meeting the fishing quota through falconry. Along the way, the falconer learns about the history of the town and the people who live in it. 

Players will get to explore the town and interact with townsfolk as the falconer. They will also catch fish and find trinkets as a falcon.
